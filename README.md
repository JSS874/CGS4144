Data: https://www.refine.bio/experiments/ERP105973/frontal-cortex-of-male-piglets-housed-in-barren-and-environmentally-enriched-conditions  

This data examines the frontal cortex of male piglets who were housed in barren and enriched environments. It looks at brain development, function, and health in these animals based on the environments they were housed. 

Scientific Question: How do the relative influences of genetic inheritance and environmental factors affect the frontal cortex of male piglets?
